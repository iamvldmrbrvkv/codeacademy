<!--header and nav-->
<!--By using a <header> tag, our code becomes easier to read. 
It is much easier to identify what is inside of the <h1>‘s parent tags, as opposed to a <div> tag which would provide no details as to what was inside of the tag.

A <nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. 
It is important to note that <nav> can be used inside of the <header> element but can also be used on its own.-->
    <header> 
        <nav>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>      
          </ul>
        </nav>
      </header>

<!--article and section-->
<!--<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. 
For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single <section>. 
A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.-->
<section>
    <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2> 
  </section>
<!--The <article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. 
<article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. 
An <article> tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.-->
    <section>
        <h2>Fun Facts About Cricket</h2>
        <article>
          <p>A single match of cricket can last up to 5 days.</p>
        </article>
      </section>
<!--In the code above, the <article> element containing a fact about cricket was placed inside of the <section> element. 
It is important to note that a <section> element could also be placed in an <article> element depending on the context.-->

<!--the aside element-->
<!--The <aside> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. 
This element can be used alongside other elements such as <article> or <section>. 
Some common uses of the <aside> element are for:

Bibliographies
Endnotes
Comments
Pull quotes
Editorial sidebars
Additional information-->
<article>
    <p>The first World Series was played between Pittsburgh and Boston in 1903 and was a nine-game series.</p>
  </article>
  <aside>
    <p>
     Babe Ruth once stated, “Heroes get remembered, but legends never die.” 
    </p>
  </aside>
<!--As shown above, the information within the <article> is the important content. 
Meanwhile the information within the <aside> enhances the information in <article> but is not required in order to understand it.-->

<!--figure and figcaption-->
<!--<figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.-->
    <figure>
        <img src="overwatch.jpg">
      </figure>
<!--<figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the <figure> tag. 
Usually, <figcaption> will go inside <figure>. 
This is different than using a <p> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of <figure>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a <figcaption> will move with the figure. 
This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.-->
<figure>
    <img src="overwatch.jpg">
    <figcaption>This picture shows characters from Overwatch.</figcaption>
  </figure>
<!--In the example above, we added a <figcaption> into the <figure> element to describe the image from the previous example. 
This helps group the <figure> content with the <figcaption> content.

While the content in <figure> is related to the main flow of the document, its position is independent. 
This means that you can remove it or move it somewhere else without affecting the flow of the document.-->

<!--audio and attributes-->
<!--The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into a document. 
Like <video>, <audio> uses src to link the audio source.-->
    <audio>
        <source src="iAmAnAudioFile.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      </audio>
<!--In this example, we created an <audio> element. 
Then we created a <source> element to encapsulate our audio link. 
In this case, iAmAnAudioFile.mp3 is our audio file. 
Then we specified the type by using type and named what kind of audio it is. 
Although not always necessary, it’s recommended that we state the type of audio as it helps the browser identify it more easily and determine if that type of audio file is supported by the browser.

We linked our audio file into the browser but now we need to give it controls. 
This is where attributes come in. Attributes provide additional information about an element.

Attributes allow us to do many different things to our audio file. 
There are many attributes for <audio> but today we’re going to be focusing on controls and src.

controls: automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.

src: specifies the URL of the audio file.

As you might have noticed, we already used the src attribute in the example code above. 
Most attributes go in the opening tag of <audio>. 
For example, here’s how we could add both autoplay functionality and audio controls:-->
<audio autoplay controls></audio>
<!--You can find other attributes here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#attributes-->

<!--video and embed-->
<!--By using a <video> element, we can add videos to our website. 
The <video> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.

Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:

controls: When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a fullscreen option.
autoplay: The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.
loop: This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.-->
<video src="coding.mp4" controls>Video not supported</video>
<!--Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the <embed> tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. 
This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. 
The <embed> tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the <video> element. 
Note that <embed> is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as <video>, <audio> and <img>, should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.-->
    <embed src="download.gif"/>
<!--In the example above, <embed> is being used to add in a gif from a local file known as download.gif. 
Embed can be used to add local files as well as media content straight from some other websites.-->

          Dogs have a sense of time. It's been proven that they know the difference between a hour and five. If conditioned to, they can predict future events, such as regular walk times.
